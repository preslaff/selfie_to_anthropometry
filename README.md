**Abstract**

This project will introduce a method to extract 16 human anthropometrics from a single smartphone selfie.

**Structure**

Directory `Project` contains project files. The project consists of directories `data`, `datasets`, `images`, `logs`, `models`, `notebooks` and notebook `Selfie_to_Anthropometry.ipynb` and `support_module.py` module. 

The archive with directories `data`, `datasets`, `models` should to be downloaded from [http://preslaff.laboletory.com/preslaff/deep_learning_final_project/data.zip](http://preslaff.laboletory.com/preslaff/deep_learning_final_project/data.zip) or within the notebook.


## **Papers**
Directory `Papers` contains the summaries of two papers and their corresponding images in directory `images`:

- ["Segment Anything"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02643.pdf)
- ["Fast Inference of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models with Offloading"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17238.pdf)

**!! Original papers should be downloaded from the links above because of the Softuni upload limit**
